&00&C--- ANSI Support --&00

&X-Dragon&x-Console&00 3.0 is compatible with ANSI Color Codes. The &X-Dragon&x-Console&00 class
has two methods that will allow you to convert between &X-Dragon&x-Console&00 Color Codes
(DCCC) and ANSI Color Codes if you so choose.

&G-FYI:&00 To make an ANSI Color Code you begin with the ESCAPE character ANSI looks
for which is "&C-\033&00" or you could use &R-dev.bbuck.dragonconsole.text.ANSI.&l-ESCAPE&00.

&G-convertToANSIColors(&l-String&G-)&00 - Converts any DCCCs in the given String to their
valid ANSI counterpart, if no valid counterpart for that color can be found then
it is replaced with "&C-[39;49m&00" which sets the foreground and background to
their defaults.

&G-convertToDCColors(&l-String&G-)&00 - Converts any ANSI codes in the given String to their
DCCC counterparts, if no DCCC counterpart can be found then the default color
code set in the &X-Dragon&x-Console&00 class will be used.

&R-- How to Enable and use ANSI Color Codes.&00

ANSI Color Code usage must be enabled in order for the console to process ANSI
codes and apply them. Enabling ANSI Codes can be done with the
&R-setUseANSIColorCodes(&l-boolean&R-)&00 method of the &X-Dragon&x-Console&00 class.

Once ANSI Codes have been enabled then the console will process and use ANSI
codes in the Strings sent to &R-append(&l-String&R-)&00.

&R-- What about Other ANSI Codes?&00

I plan to continue building upon the ANSI support, as well as the proprietary
&X-Dragon&x-Console&00 scripts and commands to make &X-Dragon&x-Console&00 a useful and easy
to implement Terminal Emulator.

&r-** IF ANSI CODES ARE ENABLED DCCC CODES WILL NOT BE APPLIED TO TEXT **

*** ANSI Codes and DCCCs will ALWAYS be processed out of any String sent to
&R-append(&l-String&R-)&r- regardless if they are enabled or not. This is important to note
because even if ANSI Codes are enabled you must pass "&&&&" to get "&&" as well as
"%%%%" to get "%%" ***&00
